            <p>Edo Period of Japan Lasted from 1603 to 1867 when japn was under the Tokugawa Shogunate which came to power after the chaos that happened durning the Sengoku Period. The Edo Period in Japan brought about econimic growth mpre strict social class to japan and making the country more and made the country more isolantionist than it already was.</p>
      
      
        <h1>Society</h1>
        <p>The Society durning the Edo Period in Japan in a big way the way you move up in the social order was based on your own personal skill and ambition rather than neptision. Neptision is way the people gain power because of their hertaige rather than hard work which is a vervy fallwed way to ruin a country or an thing for that matter. During this thime Japan divied it citizens into Separate Socail Class and it went as follows The Emperor (King), Court Nobility, Shogun, Daimyo, Samurai, Peasants and Merchants. In most if not all the the bottom two levels of the pyrimad made up of most of the population this was no differnet in Japan. While The higher levels made up less of the population but lived futher away a in more bigger and lavishi houses and castales which were rezervied for the most elite of the elite.</p>
      
      
        <h1>Foreign trade relations</h1>
       Durning the Edo Period of Japna they engage with trade with outsiders but they were suspicious of outsiders but the Tokugawa Shogunate realised the porift they made Edo into huge port city. They did this becasue teh eupoapains loved ports and they were japan biggest tardes so they elsatibest many ports around japan one of the most imporant ports was in Kyushu 
        
       
      <h1>Religion and Pholisoshe</h1>
      <p>The Religions that they had during the edo period was Confucianism, Buddhism, and Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism was spearding alot durning the edo period because before the Edo period of Japan the countrys had a lot of buddhist who kept the knowlage of confusesion studies alive. When the Tokugawa Shogunate took power the buddhist had no more reliogous controll over the teaching so it became vervy popular wiht the people. What is confuseion it was a ancient chinese belief system which foucsed ojn the imporantace of one's ethics and morality and it has no gods. Neo-Confucianism was more simplifyed than Confucianism cause it took out all the mystical elements it took from taosim and Buddhism and foucsed more on the main belives of the religon. </p>
      
      <h1>Culture</h1>
